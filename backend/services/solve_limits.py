# Solve concurrency guard: an optimizer call can legitimately use up to the shared
# solver's normal 30s budget plus process startup and cleanup. Without
# this, a spammed re-optimize button (or a script hitting these endpoints directly,
# bypassing the frontend's re-click guard) can pile up many overlapping solves on one
# worker's threadpool and starve every other request that worker is handling. Cap it
# to one in-flight solve per IP, plus a server-wide cap across all workers, and fail
# fast with 429 instead of silently queuing behind the threadpool.
#
# The per-IP part has to be a file, not an in-memory set: prod runs one Gunicorn
# worker *process* per CPU core (reset.py), each with its own copy of this module's
# state, so a plain dict/set would only catch a repeat request that happened to land
# on the same worker as the first one. A lock file under RUNTIME_DIR is visible to
# every worker, same as SYNC_IN_PROGRESS_FILE in services/sync.py.
#
# The global cap is shared across workers too. Every solve is a spawned child process
# holding a full core and its own copy of scipy, so a per-worker cap let 2 workers run
# 4 solves on the 2 core / 2 GB prod box and starve every other request.

# this, an autoclicker spamming the same build would sail past the concurrency
# guard entirely and still generate real per-request DB/HTTP load at whatever
# rate it fires. Same cooldown-dict pattern as the publish and comment cooldowns,
# just keyed by IP instead of client_id_hash since these endpoints don't require
